I've been thinking for a while that I want to start blogging again. For a while, I had grand ambitions of writing my own _super-awesome-cool-foobar_ app for it. Then I realized that grand ambitions led to me putting it off more and more.

What to do??? - [Octopress]

Yeah, I did it. Essentially, I decided that

Failure counts as done. So do mistakes. 
{% endblockquote %}

The only way I can make mistakes, and even fail, is to do. Using Octopress may not be exactly what I envisioned, but it is progress; it gets my hands dirty. That was also the motivation to creating and publishing [lambdas]: dirty hands.[^1]

I think ultimately, I'm getting better at realizing that everything is a draft[^2], and only by making progress can I hope to ever see it approach my ideals. Like lambdas, this blog will need work: content, theme, and a more coherent structure just to start. However, also like lambdas, the only way to get there is to get my hands dirty.
